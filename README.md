# rjmcmc

DESCRIPTION
___________
rjmcmc is C++ code for both a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm and a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm (SMC) to sample changepoints in continuous time processes. Currently available to specifically run on data modelled as a either a poisson process or a shot noise cox process although easily extended to other processes.

VERSION
_______
Version 1.0 uploaded on 09th February 2015.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
_____________________
Unix and GSL - Gnu scientific library

INSTALLATION AND BUILDING
_________________________
Download source code and run make mainRJ_example or make mainSMC_example in the source directory for use of the RJMCMC code or SMC code respectively. In the source directory ./mainRJ_example -h or ./mainSMC_example -h will describe the options for input and output for running the code. 


DATA FORMAT
___________
The data file should contain space delimited values, refer to the two example data files shot_noise.txt and coal_data_renormalised.txt.

DOCUMENTATION
_____________
Some brief description of the algorithm and the model provided in the Documentation subfolder but mostly still under development, contact authors with any inquiries.
